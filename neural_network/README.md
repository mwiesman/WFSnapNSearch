## About the neural_network component

The neural_network component handles the image multi-labeling recoginition of SnapNSearch. 
It is a multi-labeling convolutional neural network finetuned from CaffeNet using Caffe. 
For detailed configuration of our Caffe configuration. Please see Caffe_config.md
