## About the WFSnapNSearch

WFSnapNSearch was created as a project for the Wayfair hackathon. The project goal was to train a neural network model on specifically Wayfair data to be used for image recognition and searching. The user could then provide an image of some product (whether it be a photo they had taken or one from online) to our project and the model would be able to determine as much about the image that would be relevant to find similar products on Wayfair.com. The information determined by the model would then be sent as a search query to Wayfair.com resulting in a "search by image" functionality.
